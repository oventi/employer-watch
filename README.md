# Employer Watch
API and group of apps to identify which employers are paying fairly to their employees

## Motivation
Ever since I migrated to Australia, I have noticed and keept my self informed about work exploitation. The issue started affecting me more personally when my partner was underpaid in a job. I [wrote about](http://15hoursahead.com/worker-exploitation-in-australia/) it in my blog, and algo got motivated to create a way to show employers who underpay.

## Purpose
1. Help people find a fair place to apply for a job, avoiding exploitation
2. Let consumers buy from fair workplaces and avoid places who exploit employees
