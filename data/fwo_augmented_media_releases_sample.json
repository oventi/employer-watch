        "text":"The Fair Work Ombudsman has commenced legal action against the owner of a nail salon in Adelaide, alleging he failed to take appropriate action after being put on notice to pay employees correctly.\nFacing Court is Albert Tran, owner of Citi Nails & Beauty in the Westfield Tea Tree Plaza at Modbury, and his company Hongyen Pty Ltd.\nIt is alleged that Mr Tran and his company underpaid five employees who performed nail treatments at his salon a total of $7493.\nThe underpayments were allegedly the result of Hongyen paying two of the employees as trainees despite no registered traineeships being in place and classifying the other three at the wrong level under the Hair and Beauty Industry Award.\nIt is alleged that most of the underpayment relates to one worker who was underpaid $6346 as a result of being short-changed her minimum hourly rate and leave entitlements between July, 2014 and June, 2016.\nThe other four employees were allegedly variously underpaid minimum hourly rates, a casual loading and weekend penalty rates for shorter periods between August, 2015 and June, 2016.\nThe alleged underpayments were discovered during a follow-up audit conducted by the Fair Work Ombudsman. Mr Tran and his company back-paid the employees last year.\nFair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the decision was made to commence legal action because Mr Tran and his company were put on notice to pay employees correctly in 2013 when a proactive auditing campaign identified non-compliance issues that resulted in Hongyen back-paying several employees.\n“We are prepared to take action against employers who fail to take appropriate corrective action after we educate them about their obligations under workplace laws,” Ms James said.\nHongyen faces penalties of up to $51,000 per contravention, while Mr Tran faces maximum penalties of up to $10,200 per contravention.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Court Orders for Hongyen to display a workplace notice detailing minimum employee entitlements and to commission workplace relations training for managerial employees and a professional external audit of its pay practices.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking an injunction restraining Mr Tran and Hongyen from underpaying workers in future.\nIf the injunctions are granted, Mr Tran and his company could face contempt of court proceedings for any further underpayment contraventions proven in court.\nEmployers and employees seeking assistance can visit www.fairwork.gov.au or contact the Fair Work Infoline on 13 13 94.

The FWO audited a total of 34 franchisees of which, 32 engaged delivery drivers. Audits have been finalised with respect to 26 of the franchisees who engaged drivers while inquiries into the remaining six franchisees are ongoing.\nOf the 26 completed audits, 24 franchisees (92 per cent) were found to be non-compliant with only two franchisees found to be meeting all of their legal obligations.\nOf the 24 non-compliant franchisees, the activity found:\nTo date, the FWO is addressing these issues by:\nIn addition, the FWO is considering potential litigation with respect to one franchisee.\nGiven the extent of non-compliance with respect to arrangements for delivery drivers, preliminary discussions relating to a proactive compliance partnership have been held with the owners of the Pizza Hut franchise.\nFair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says people employed as delivery drivers are often very young, making them more vulnerable to exploitation in the workplace.\n“Thirty-two per cent of the 170 workers we dealt with as part of this Activity Report were under the age of 24,” Ms James said.\n“We know that younger people, who have less experience in the workplace are more likely to be unaware of their rights.\n“Through the course of our Activity, we found a number of outlets engaging drivers as independent contractors rather than employees. In some instances, drivers were paid as little as $5.70 per delivery while also being made to cover fuel and vehicle operating costs.\n“The FWO will continue to monitor Pizza Hut outlets and will follow up with those identified through this process to ensure that areas of non-compliance are being addressed,” Ms James said.\nTools to assist employers to comply with workplace laws are available at www.fairwork.gov.au\nResources include a Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT) that employers can use to determine the pay rates applicable to their employees, including base pay rates, allowances, overtime and penalty rates.\nMs James says that in recognition that some employees are reluctant to complain about their workplace issues, the Agency now has an “Anonymous Report” function to allow the community to report potential workplace breaches.\nIntelligence can be provided confidentially at www.fairwork.gov.au/tipoff\nFollow Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James on Twitter @NatJamesFWO , the Fair Work Ombudsman @fairwork_gov_au  or find us on Facebook www.facebook.com/fairwork.gov.au .\nSign up to receive the Fair Work Ombudsman’s media releases direct to your email inbox at  www.fairwork.gov.au/mediareleases.\nRead the Fair Work Ombudsman's Activity Report on Pizza Hut outlets\nMedia inquiries:\nBryan Littlely, Assistant Director, MediaMobile: 0447 692 007 bryan.littlely@fwo.gov.au\nIf you might need to read this information again,  save it for later so you can access it quickly and easily.\nPlease note that comments aren’t monitored for personal information or workplace complaints.

Workers continued to perform work in the same manner as they had previously done and were to be paid the same flat rate, however they were not paid any superannuation.\nThe FWO alleges that this amounts to sham contracting as the workers were still in an employer and employee relationship with AVA Travel and were not genuinely engaged as independent contractors.\nIn addition to allegations of sham contracting, an investigation carried out by the FWO found that by paying employees a flat rate of $20.59 for all hours worked, AVA Travel had significantly underpaid its workers. The underpayments were a result of failing to pay the correct rates for a range of work including weekend hours, public holiday hours and overtime.\nInspectors calculated that one employee was short-changed a total of $27,938.61 while the second employee was underpaid by $15,538.60.\nAVA Travel has acknowledged the underpayments and set in place a payment plan to reimburse the workers.\nFair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the agency took the matter to court due to the nature of the alleged contraventions and the significant amount of underpayments that occurred over such a short timeframe.\n“The FWO has commenced proceedings relating to sham contracting in the passenger vehicle industry previously and the allegations put forward in this case are also very concerning,” Ms James said.\nSham contracting is a serious contravention of the Fair Work Act 2009 where employers attempt to avoid their obligations by disguising employment arrangements as independent contracting arrangements.\n“It is important that employers in all industries understand that they cannot avoid their obligations under workplace laws by applying a false label to an employment relationship,” Ms James said.\nEmployees and employers who are unsure about their workplace rights and obligations can seek assistance at www.fairwork.gov.au or call the Fair Work Infoline on 13 13 94.\nSmall business owners can opt to receive priority assistance when calling the Infoline.\nAn interpreter service is also available on 13 40 50.\nInformation to assist people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds has been translated into 27 languages and is available on the website.\nThe Agency recently launched an Anonymous Report function which enables members of the community to alert the Fair Work Ombudsman to potential workplace issues.\nIntelligence can be provided at www.fairwork.gov.au/tipoff.\nFollow Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James on Twitter @NatJamesFWO , the Fair Work Ombudsman @fairwork_gov_au  or find us on Facebook www.facebook.com/fairwork.gov.au .\nSign up to receive the Fair Work Ombudsman’s media releases direct to your email inbox at  www.fairwork.gov.au/mediareleases.\nMedia inquiries:\nMark Lee, Director, Media\r\nMobile: 0408 547 381\r\nmark.lee@fwo.gov.au\nIf you might need to read this information again,  save it for later so you can access it quickly and easily.\nPlease note that comments aren’t monitored for personal information or workplace complaints.

The company’s former director Yangyang Li, who is a registered migration agent, is alleged to have been involved in a record keeping contravention.\nIt is alleged that two workers, both Chinese women aged 24 when their employment began, were underpaid a total of $17,039 when they were employed at the company’s Brisbane office between April and August, 2015.\nOne was in Australia on a temporary graduate visa, while the other was on a temporary resident visa at the time, before becoming a permanent Australian resident.\nThey generally worked 80 hours per fortnight but were paid flat hourly rates of between $10 and $11.25. One of the workers also received some commission payments.\nThey were allegedly entitled to have been paid minimum hourly rates ranging from $16.87 to $18.38, with one of the workers allegedly also entitled to overtime rates ranging from $26.90 to $36.76 per hour.\nIt is alleged that one of the workers was also unlawfully paid nothing for her initial two weeks of work on the basis that it was purported ‘unpaid training’.\nIt is alleged that leave and public holiday entitlements were also underpaid and that record-keeping and pay slip laws were contravened.\nFair Work Ombudsman inspectors investigated after one of the workers lodged a request for assistance.\nThe workers were back-paid in full last year.\nFair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says legal action is being taken because of the alleged blatant underpayment of two vulnerable workers.\n“We treat underpayment of overseas workers particularly seriously because they can be vulnerable if they are not fully aware of their rights or reluctant to complain,” Ms James said.\nZNZ Education faces a penalty of up to $54,000 per contravention, while Ms Zhang and Mr Li face penalties of up to $10,800 and $5,400 per contravention respectively.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking a Court Order requiring ZNZ Education to commission a professional external audit of its pay practices and report the results, as well as a Court Order requiring the company, Mr Li and Ms Zhang to complete the Online Learning Courses for employers at www.fairwork.gov.au.\nA directions hearing is scheduled for the Federal Circuit Court in Brisbane on 13 February.\nMs James says the step was taken to take legal action against the human resources manager as an alleged accessory because of her allegedly significant role in calculating and paying wages, creating pay slips and approving periods of leave.\nIt is the fourth matter in which the Fair Work Ombudsman has included a human resources manager as an accessory to one of its legal actions.\n“We are prepared to take action against managerial staff who facilitate the underpayment of employees’ minimum entitlements,” Ms James said.\nMs James says it is also disappointing to find a migration agency committing alleged serious contraventions of workplace laws because migration agencies have an important role to play in increasing awareness of workplace laws among migrant groups.\nIn a recent speech to the Migration Institute of Australia National Conference, Ms James appealed to migration agents to assist in dispelling the myth that migrant workers are not entitled to the same wages as Australian citizens.\nMs James says she is concerned about the number of employers from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds who have been in breach of workplace laws, particularly when they are employing workers from within their own communities.\n“I want to make it clear to all employers that minimum wage rates, record-keeping obligations and the issuing of pay slips apply to everyone in Australia and they are not negotiable,” she said.\n“I understand there are cultural challenges and vastly different laws in other parts of the world, but it is incumbent on all businesses operating in Australia to understand and apply Australian laws. To that end, the Fair Work Ombudsman is here to help with free advice and resources in a range of languages.”\nIn the 2015-16 financial year, 38 of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s 50 litigations (76 per cent) involved a visa holder, and more than $3 million was recovered for all visa-holders.\nEmployers and employees seeking assistance can visit www.fairwork.gov.au or call the Fair Work Infoline on 13 13 94.\nAn interpreter service is available on 13 14 50 and information on the website is translated into 27 different languages.\nFollow Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James on Twitter @NatJamesFWO , the Fair Work Ombudsman @fairwork_gov_au  or find us on Facebook www.facebook.com/fairwork.gov.au .\nSign up to receive the Fair Work Ombudsman’s media releases direct to your email inbox at www.fairwork.gov.au/mediareleases.\nMedia inquiries:\nMatthew Raggatt, Senior Media Adviser\r\nMobile: 0466 470 507\r\nmatthew.raggatt@fwo.gov.au\nIf you might need to read this information again,  save it for later so you can access it quickly and easily.\nPlease note that comments aren’t monitored for personal information or workplace complaints.

The workers have now been back-paid in full.\nWorkplace laws relating to providing employees with a Fair Work Information Statement and information about their classification and status were also contravened.\nFair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says it is unacceptable that the underpayments occurred despite Fair Work inspectors putting WY Pty Ltd, Chua and Fu on notice to pay staff correctly in 2012 after finding employees were being paid unlawfully low, flat rates.\n“Despite the warning we issued in 2012, the business continued to recruit and underpay vulnerable overseas workers and had not changed the initial flat hourly rates it was paying in almost four years,” Ms James said.\n“The penalties send a clear message to business operators that if they ignore our warnings to fix up underpayment problems, we are prepared to take legal action and serious consequences will apply.\n“We treat cases involving underpayment of overseas workers particularly seriously because we are conscious that they can be vulnerable due to a lack of awareness of their entitlements, language barriers and a reluctance to complain.”\nMs James says it is significant that the internal payroll and account manager of the business was penalised for being an accessory to the contraventions.\n“While not being primarily responsible for operating the business, this manager was fully aware employees were being deliberately underpaid and helped to facilitate the exploitation of two vulnerable workers,” she said.\n“Managerial staff need to be aware that knowingly facilitating the underpayment of employees’ minimum entitlements is serious, unlawful conduct and will not be tolerated.”\nIn addition to the penalties, the Fair Work Ombudsman secured Court Orders requiring WY Pty Ltd to include Fast Food Industry Award details and Fair Work Ombudsman contact information in all job advertisements it places for two years, including on overseas websites – and to provide new employees with a copy of the Fair Work Information Statement (FWIS) in their language of choice.\nIt is the first time the Fair Work Ombudsman has secured such Court Orders and reflects the Agency’s concern that the business has recruited overseas workers and exploited their vulnerability.\nMs James says she is concerned about the number of employers from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds who have been in breach of workplace laws, particularly when they are employing workers from within their own communities.\n“I want to make it clear to all employers that minimum wage rates, record-keeping obligations and the issuing of pay slips apply to everyone in Australia and they are not negotiable,” she said.\n“I understand there are cultural challenges and vastly different laws in other parts of the world, but it is incumbent on all businesses operating in Australia to understand and apply Australian laws. To that end, the Fair Work Ombudsman is here to help with free advice and resources in a range of languages.”\nMs James says her Agency is also committed to improving compliance in the hospitality industry.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman’s three-year National Hospitality Industry Campaign, finalised last year, resulted in more than $2 million being recovered for underpaid employees.\nEmployers and employees can visit www.fairwork.gov.au or phone the Fair Work Infoline on 13 13 94. An interpreter service is available by calling 13 14 50.\nInformation to assist people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds has been translated into 27 languages and is available on the website. The Agency also has fact sheets tailored to overseas workers and international students on the website and YouTube videos in 14 languages to assist workers to understand their workplace rights.\nNOTE: WY Pty Ltd sold the ‘Hanaichi Japanese Fine Food’ outlets at Chermside in August, 2015 and the current operators of the outlets have no involvement in these proceedings.\nFollow Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James on Twitter @NatJamesFWO , the Fair Work Ombudsman @fairwork_gov_au  or find us on Facebook www.facebook.com/fairwork.gov.au .\nSign up to receive the Fair Work Ombudsman’s media releases direct to your email inbox at  www.fairwork.gov.au/mediareleases.\nMedia inquiries:\nRyan Pedler, Assistant Director - Media\r\nMobile: 0411 430 902\r\nryan.pedler@fwo.gov.au\nIf you might need to read this information again,  save it for later so you can access it quickly and easily.\nPlease note that comments aren’t monitored for personal information or workplace complaints.

including two teenagers and four overseas workers on working holiday visas - who worked across the Brunswick outlet and Mr Buzza’s former Burger Buzz outlet in West Melbourne.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman has now commenced a second legal action against Mr Buzza and his company, alleging they short-changed a further five employees who worked at the Brunswick outlet a total of $7513 between December, 2015 and July, 2016.\nTwo of the workers were aged just 19 and one was an overseas worker from France who was in Australia on a 417 working holiday visa at the time.\nAs with the first legal action, the workers were allegedly underpaid for short periods of work ranging from two to six weeks.\nIt is alleged that one of the workers was paid nothing for work performed, while the other four were paid only a fraction of their lawful entitlements.\nThis allegedly resulted in underpayment of the workers’ minimum hourly rates, late night allowances and penalty rates for weekend and public holiday work.\nFair Work Ombudsman inspectors investigated after workers lodged requests for assistance.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman alleges Mr Buzza and his company also contravened workplace laws by knowingly providing inspectors with false and misleading records and failing to comply with a Notice to Produce employment records.\nWorkplace laws relating to pay slips, frequency of pay and meal breaks were allegedly also breached.\nActing Fair Work Ombudsman Michael Campbell says it is of concern that Mr Buzza’s business has been the subject of a number of previous underpayment allegations from employees, and inspectors had formally advised him of minimum pay obligations on at least two occasions in 2014.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman also has ongoing investigations into further requests for assistance from workers who claim they were underpaid at the Burger Buzz outlet in Brunswick.\n“We are concerned that the allegations made by a series of workers suggest a pattern of non-compliant behaviour and a business model based on the exploitation of vulnerable workers,” Mr Campbell said.\nMr Buzza faces maximum penalties ranging from $3600 to $10,800 per contravention and Rum Runner Trading Pty Ltd faces penalties of up to $18,000 to $54,000 per contravention.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman is also seeking Court Orders for Mr Buzza and his company to back-pay the employees in full and an injunction restraining Mr Buzza and his company from underpaying workers in future.\nIf the injunction is granted, Mr Buzza and his company could face contempt of court proceedings for any further underpayment contraventions that are proven in court.\nA directions hearing is scheduled for the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on February 15.\nMr Campbell says employers need to be aware that exploitation of vulnerable workers is serious conduct that will not be tolerated.\n“We treat underpayment of young and overseas workers particularly seriously because they can be vulnerable if they are not fully aware of their entitlements or reluctant to complain,” he said.\nIn the 2015-16 financial year, 38 of the Fair Work Ombudsman’s 50 litigations (76 per cent) involved a visa holder. Sixteen of those litigations involved a 417 visa holder.\nIn 2015-16, the Fair Work Ombudsman recovered just over $3 million for all visa-holders, with $1.37 million of this for 417 visa-holders.\nMr Campbell says the Fair Work Ombudsman is also committed to improving compliance in the hospitality industry.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman’s three-year National Hospitality Industry Campaign, finalised last year, resulted in more than $1.2 million being recovered for underpaid employees at restaurants, cafés and catering companies throughout Australia.\nEmployers and employees seeking assistance can visit www.fairwork.gov.au or contact the Fair Work Infoline on 13 13 94.\nAn interpreter service is available on 13 14 50 and information on the website is translated into 27 different languages.\nFollow Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James on Twitter @NatJamesFWO , the Fair Work Ombudsman @fairwork_gov_au  or find us on Facebook www.facebook.com/fairwork.gov.au .\nSign up to receive the Fair Work Ombudsman’s media releases direct to your email inbox at  www.fairwork.gov.au/mediareleases.\nMedia inquiries:\nBryan Littlely, Assistant Director, Media\r\nMobile: 0447 692 007 \r\nbryan.littlely@fwo.gov.au\nIf you might need to read this information again,  save it for later so you can access it quickly and easily.\nPlease note that comments aren’t monitored for personal information or workplace complaints.
